CnBlogsClient
=============

This is a client program for [http://www.cnblogs.com](http://www.cnblogs.com "博客园") which implemented using Qt framework. The purpose of this program is to provide a quick way to access to cnblogs for users. Besides, Qt is my favourite tool and I am enjoying when implementing this project.
